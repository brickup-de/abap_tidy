A practical consequence of the [_Test publics, not private internals_](/clean-code/testing/principles/test-publics-not-private-internals/),
type your code under test with an _interface_

```ABAP
DATA code_under_test TYPE REF TO some_interface.
```

rather than a _class_

```ABAP
" anti-pattern
DATA code_under_test TYPE REF TO some_class.
```
